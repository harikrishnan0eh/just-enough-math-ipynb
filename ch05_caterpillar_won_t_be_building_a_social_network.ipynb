However, they still take their own sweet time when it comes to mixing perfect drinks. Salaries for bartenders totaled $600K last quarter, and the overall time per cocktail category clocked in at a 10:4:5 ratio. Bar charts don’t lie. Meanwhile, drone-based delivery is still somewhat of an art form. We lost our shirts, shelling out a whopping $150K last quarter just for deliveries. Turns out that muddled drinks tend to be not only trendy but much heavier, so our airborne delivery costs for the different categories were in a 1:1:3 ratio. Oddly enough, we were fortunate to barter for our remaining expenses, such as accounting, datacenter, marketing, etc. Most of those services were being run by um, “social” drinkers."
